        <p>
        I found inner engineering book in November 2019 and brought from the Amazon kindle to read it. First week into the reading i found most of my inner questions being answered in an simplest way. What could have taken me years to understand came down to me in an instant experientially and i was more awake than ever. Moreover i was conscious than ever before and 100% involve in all what i am doing. I taught myself coding and making websites, and now writing articles following the principles of inner engineering. I downloaded the audio version of book and since then it has been my constant companion. So, today i decided to bring that note of mine into the small article to summarise the book knowledge for everyone to read.

        <h3>
             Part One contains five chapters: When I Lost My Sense, The Way Out Is In, Design Your Destiny, No Boundary No Burden, ...And Now, Yoga. Part Two has four chapters: Body, Mind, Energy, and Joy.
        </h3>

        <p>
            Book starts with the description of author, his path of enlightement through yoga and stories of Akbar and Birbal and many more. The book is full with small stories of shankaran Pilla(a gentleman from India) and many yogic stories and their achievements of different kinds. The book says Yoga is the path where you have to come when you realise your main desire is to be limitless. It is a technology for well-being derived from the science of Yoga. There are plenty more in the book in this part but some of the intersting things that everyone should know are in second part as well. So, i have include some interesting wisdom into summary here. Let's get going...   
        </p>

        <p style="border: 2px solid orangered;">
            "As there is a science and technology to create external well-being, there is a whole dimension of science and technology for inner well-being." <br>
            ——Sadhguru——

            Body
        </h3>

        <p>
            The physical body is designed and function without any intervention. Everything that is needed for our physical existence is happening in its own. Our body is the most sophisticated machinery on this planet. Every other machines has come out of this body and human being wanting it to happen. It embodies the most higher level of mechanics, the highest level of electronics and the most sophisticated circuit you can ever imagine. The very source of creation is functioning inside you. The  life is one thing and source of life is another thing.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Though we have compulsiveness towards physical, we also have the consciousness of being more than just physical. One is the instinct of self-preservation and other is the constant aspire to expand, to become boundless. Preserve and expand are not two opposing forces instead they can be seen as the two sides of same coin. One force helps us to root ourself in this planet and another takes us beyond. The human desire to become boundless is completely natural. To journey from the boundful individual to boundless source of creation is basis of spiritual process. <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44266/mending-wall"> Something there is that doesn't love a wall </a>because your self-preservation instinct keep telling you unless you have walls you are not safe so people keep building.
        </h4>

        <p>
           The sense organs are limited, they can percieve which that are physical. The sense perception is the essence for life. The essential nature of life doesn't lie in the physical or physicological expression of body and mind but  in their source. Yoga is fundamentally aim towards expanding beyond five sense perception using physical posture to direct your energy in certain direction.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-center">
            Earth, air, water, fire and ether are the components of the physical body.
        </h3>

        <h4>
            Your body can recognise the physical change in the surrounding if you could keep your awareness focus and razor sharp. Our body is in sink with sun, from where we get the energy and moon which cause the tides in ocean. If you observe the body properly there is a cycle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala">Mandala,</a> 40-48 days in which your body doesn't need food for 2-3day. Our body work at its best when the stomach is empty thats why in Hinduism and buddhism day of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekadashi">Ekadashi</a> has been taken as fasting day. 
        </h4>

        <p>
            Be conscious of what and how much you eat. This body is the accumulation of food, so be sure what kind of food you are giving it. Just get in tune with it. You will see that you will pass through everything easily. When it comes to food and sleep the body is the best judge. So, let the body decide how much it should eat today and how much sleep it needs. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-center">
            Mind
        </h3>

        <p>
            Existence is the quest between manifest and unmanifest. The moment there is manifest, there will be duality. Though unity is the divine of life, duality brings the texture, design and color to life. The mind has 16 dimension which fall into four categories. 
            <ul>
                <li>Intellect(Discerning and discriminatory dimension)</li>
                <li>Memory(Accumulative dimesion) </li>
                <li>Awareness(the inner dimension)</li>
                <li>Identity(aspect from where you derive your sense of identity)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>
            Examine with yourself and you will find every thought that arrives at mind has its root in data that you have already accumulated. In such a state nothing new is possible so, intellect loses its pace and became a trap. When you keep your intellect deepen in this limited fragment of accumulated dimension of your mind you draw conclusions about life that are completely distorted.If you want to reach your ultimate nature through your mind, you need to make the intellect truely discriminatory.
        </h4>

        <p>
            Learn to discriminate the real from the illusionary, What is existencially true and what is psychologically true? If you soak your intellect in awareness the discerning dimension of your mind can turn into a miraculous tool of liberation. Mental alertness enhance the ability to survive in the world, useful in self preservation.
        </p>

        <h3 class='text-center'>
            Awareness
        </h3>

        <p>
            Finally a deeper dimension of mind which connects us with which is the basis of creation. When you are in touch of this dimension you are in state of heightened awareness which allows you to be fully conscious and intoxicated at the same time. sleep, wakefulness and death are the different level of awareness. The awaken person sleeps too but he manage himself in such way that some part of him doesn't sleep. The sense organs shut down, body rest a bit but everything else in on, the awareness is on.
        </p>

        <h4>
            If you keep your thoughts, emotion and energy properly aligned awareness will blossom. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etheric_body"> Ether </a> as discussed before is the component of body which is outside the body. It envelop the physical body usually upto the distance of 18 to 21 inches. Anything that happen at the certain level of intensity in your life is written into this field of ether around you. when you get conscious access to your awareness you gain access to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etheric_body">etheric dimension</a> around your body, planet, solar system and the universe. Ancients have done a great discoveries in stars and planets without any technologies because of this dimension they got access to. 
        </h4>

        <h3 class="text-center">
            Recognise what is death? 
        </h3>  

        <h4 style="border: 2px solid blue">
            "No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it, and that is how it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new." <br>
            ——Steve Jobs——
        </h4>

        <p>
            If you are aware at the moment of death you shall be aware beyond death as well. Sleep is nothing but a temporary death. Every night you are gifted with the possibility to become aware beyond death. If you could be aware of the last moment when you make awakeness to sleep, you will be aware throughout your sleep. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha">Gautama the buddha</a> was supposed to have lived 2500 years ago and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus">Jesus</a> 2000 years ago. Yet, they are the living reality of today because they managed to keep their energy aligned in awareness and got connected with the source of creation. 
        </p>   

        <h3 class="text-center">
            Energy
        </h3>

        <h4 style="border: 2px solid green">
            Knowledge is the accumulated information, knowing is the living intelligence. "Any fool can know the point is to understand." <br>
            --Albert Einstein--
        </h4>

        <p>
            Recognise every aspects of life, from a grain of sand to mountain, drop to ocean, from atomic to cosmic is a manifestion of a far greater intellect than your intellect. The idea of good and bad, right and wrong all are mental aspects. They have nothing to do with life as such. Your ideas of good and bad are just a certain level of prejeduice against life. The moment you get identified around you become completely twisted. Your intellect function around this identification in such a way that you never see the world as it is. Look at the life just the way it is. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Your mind could be in five different state. 
            <ol>
                <li>It could be inert(it is not activated at all).</li>
                <li>If you energise it become active but scattered.</li>
                <li>If you energise it further it is no longer scattered but start oscillating.</li>
                <li>If you energise it further it becomes one pointed.</li>
                <li>If you energise further is become conscious.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h4>
            The way you think, the way you will fell and vice versa. In Yoga memory is regarded as the complex amalgam of memory that molds emotion in a particular way. Emotion is the juicer part of thought. You can enjoy its sweetness but it is largely the though that leads to it. The more deal with life, you will see it is an endless unfathomable process. You can't get it because you are it. When you realise experientially every atom, every grain of sand, every peeble, every piece of life from the smallest to biggest are unfathomable you will simply bow down to it. It is only when we consciously head in the direction of life energy, we find equaminity and harmony. Only in such a state we would dare to explore highest leve of excuburance and venture into the deepest mysteries of life.
